This is still a work in progress.

Eventual goal will be have a code generator that generates a sample
assembly program, plus a known list of how many opcodes of each
type should happen.

Then a separate program will run the program through perf and
then validate the output.

Possible extension -> genetic algorithm to try to find highest
diversion?
